Histogram of oriented gradients?


results did show that inception-V3 surpassed voting system. can we surpass it?


widely preferred brain-tumor data is available for free at fig-share?

individually, resnet-50 performed the best! and CNN-MRI performed the worst

ideas:

we could also experiment by converting MRI to fourier image and 
then try to predict whats the accuracy?


what would the CNN-MRI perform if we convert the MRI images into fourier transformed image?
