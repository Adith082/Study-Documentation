-> convolution operation can learn a lot of spatial dimensional data.


computer vision vs machine vision

computer vision vs human vision

there are so many approaches in computer-vision that do not possess deep-learning or machine-learning! they are rule based heuristic!
there are so many approaches in computer-bison that do posses deeplearning, machine learning

early 2010's
people were making filters(rulebased) to change image quality. for example
there is so called Laplacian smoothing filter that can make a noisy image smooth! by just using the filter. 
You can make a filter that could perform transform like that but you have to be a smart person to do that don't you?

similarly we can have laplace edge detector filter(3by3 kernel maybe?)
similarly we have sobel edge detection, canny edge detection (based on how the filters are implemented which give different type of edge only images)

when we use filters, after applying element wise multiplication, we can use some rules like below.
-> always take absolute value.
-> normalize what ever values you get from 0 to 255

how does sobel, canny edge detection works?
when ever we get a sudden change between colors the filters try to detect that edge part!

it is very difficult to come up with one filter that fit all the requirements. 


there are traditional computer vision systems (rulebased aka heuristic system), there are only ml based systems
and most importantly there are (overlap of (computer vision and and ML) --> deeplearning convolution) systems

why is ML based Computervision good?


in 2012 Alexnet came to the picture, a deepCNN trained with imagenet(popular benchmark(if your model performs good in this dataset, 
then you have a very good machine learning mode) dataset) and created history
Alex net architecture introduced maxpooling, relu activation function instead of tanh activation function.
performed by a large margin in imagenet dataset competition.

AlexNet showed that Deep learning can outperform traditional methods (SVM's, random forests etc.)
AlexNet paper showed that using GPU we can train deep neural networks faster!

in machinelearning sometimes we need to manually extract features from data which we feed into algorithm.
but in deep learninign we don't even need to do that. it would automatically extract features and learn patterns to classify!

shallow neural network vs deep neural network

every neural network has 1 input layer and 1 output layer and some hidden layer.
shallow neural network has 1 or 2 hidden layers where deep neural network has so much more hidden layer thats why they are called as 'deep'
