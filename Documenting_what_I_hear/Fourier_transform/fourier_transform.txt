fourier transform is a way to decompose a signal to multiple child signals that sum up to that signal.
it states that every signal can be decomposed into 1 or many other signals!

so when we do fourier transform of images, this transform converts the image to different frequency components(aka child signals).



what are the high frequency components in images? these are edges! we can use high pass filter to mask low frequencies and apply it to image.
In that case, we get the edges of images only(we can do edge detection of images by making a filter which masks the ).  Similarly, if you mask
the high frequency parts then you would create smoothing filter which would provide blurry images.

in the fourier space, you mask some frequency, then you recreate images from that masked fourier space to get filtered images.
