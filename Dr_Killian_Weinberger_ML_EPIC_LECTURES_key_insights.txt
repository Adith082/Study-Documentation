-------------> day1 supervised learning -----------------
bag of words are a text representations where we track the frequency of each words

each data sample is a vector of d dimension where d is the number of vocabulary available and for that particular sample 
we have the record of which words  existed and how many times they existed?


imagine my vocabulary has 5 words of the following:
apple, can, bat, I, have (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) th element of vocabulary

if my sample text is "I have have apple"
then the vector representation of the text would look like below
[1, 0, 0, 2, 1] each value refereeing to the frequency of the word in my sample text
