radiology

--> different modalities

Different modalities present different aspects (time of exposition, scanning methods, use of radioactive isotopes)

we prefer images that can be acquired in a short time
sometimes this is not possible, like in nuclear medicine where you use radioactive isotypes. slower method like for nuclear medicine inserting 
inside patient and wait for a long time to get a picture which leads to lower resolution images.

The goals of medical image analysis are:

    Quantification, measuring the features of a medical image (like area or volume)
    Segmentation, which is a step used in general to make features measurable (you segment an object and you measure the properties)
    Computer-aided diagnosis, given measurements and features makes a diagnosis.
