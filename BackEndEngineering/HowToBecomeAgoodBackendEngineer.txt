Honestly, there is no short-cut or exact road map to become better at backend engineering. What we can do is stick with fundamentals
and it can be a good head-start!

Let us look at the fundamental concepts shall we?

Communication Protocols
-------------------------
              (communication protocols link)
       frontend <------------------------> backend
almost all of these protocols are built on top of TCP and UDP

it is very important to have understanding of TCP(connection oriented protocol, provides reliable delivery) and UDP(message based connectionless, does not guarantee message delivery but faster and start).

HTTP/2 introduced application level stream.

what is TCP Head of line problem? How it was solved?
