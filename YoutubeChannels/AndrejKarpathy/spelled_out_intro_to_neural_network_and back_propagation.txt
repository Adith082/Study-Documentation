autograd is an automatic gradient engine which implements backpropagation. it is a library created by Andrej karpathy.

backpropagation is an algorithm that efficientlt calculates gradient of some kind of a loss function with respect to weights of a neural network. it would allow
us to tune the weights of neural network which would minimize the loss function and therefore increase the accuracy of the neural network.

backpropagation lies at the heart of pytorch and other modern deep neural network library.
