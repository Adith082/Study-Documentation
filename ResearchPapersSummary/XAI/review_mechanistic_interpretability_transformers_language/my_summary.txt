a task centric roadmap for beginners who want to brush up this interpretability technique called mechanistic interpretability.

what is mechanistic interpretability?
a technique that attemps to revers-engineer computations into human-understandable mechanisms.
(like giving insignts about attention heads and neurons!)
it's like how humans reverse engineer binaries into understandable language (code).

Mechanistic Interpretability (3 fundamental objects of study)

-> features

-> circuits

-> Universality

features
---------
you give llm an input called "dog"

then llm might extract animal, pet, has4legs etc.
using MI you can figure from dog to what features llm could extract like the ones above.

circuits
----------
how do you think the "features" are cracked by LLMs from given input "dog"? ciruites find them out.
circuitsâ€“ meaningful computational pathways that connect features and facilitate specific LM behaviors(like reasoning)

More formally, if we view an LM M as a computational graph with features as nodes and the weighted
 connections between them as edges, a circuit is a sub-graph of M responsible for implementing specific
 LM behaviors
